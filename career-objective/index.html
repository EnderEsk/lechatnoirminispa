                        <p class="vision-author">â€• Maya Angelou</p>
                        <p class="vision-description">Inspired by Maya Angelou's words, I believe the most meaningful work is in making people feel valued, beautiful, and cared for. Throughout my career, whether through designing costumes, face painting, or helping someone choose the perfect outfit, I have seen the impact of helping others feel confident and seen.</p>
                        <p class="vision-description">Completing my Esthetics course expanded my skills and gave me a creative, hands-on way to care for clients. I discovered both where my strengths lie and how much joy I find in services such as manicures, pedicures, waxing, lash lifts, eyelash extensions, and professional makeup artistry.</p>
                        <p class="vision-description">I am currently preparing a home-based esthetics studio where I will be offering a range of services starting October. In the meantime, I am seeking opportunities with organizations such as Shoppers or London Drugs to gain experience, continue growing, and share my knowledge of skin care and makeup with clients.</p>
                        <p class="vision-description">I view esthetics as a lifelong learning journey. My goal is to keep expanding my knowledge and skills so I can provide the highest level of care and artistry. I am also open to refining my path further should the right opportunity present itself.</p>
